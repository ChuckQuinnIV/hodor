I made this as a fun boilerplate for Alexa skills. Feel free to clone this repo for the basics for developing a new Alexa skill hosted on AWS Lambda!

## NPM Packages

Make sure you run `yarn upgrade` before starting development. I added the packages that are relevant now, but there will certainly be changes in the future that I may not accomodate in this repo.
